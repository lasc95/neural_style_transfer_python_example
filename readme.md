## Project Title
Neural Style Transfer with VGG19

## Project Description
This project uses the VGG19 model, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, to apply the style of one image to another image while preserving the content of the original image. This technique is known as neural style transfer.

## Installation
To run the project, you need to install the following libraries:
- numpy
- keras
- scipy

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy keras scipy
